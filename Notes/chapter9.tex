\subsection{Homotopy of Paths}

\begin{definition}[Homotopy]
If $f$ and $f^{\prime}$ are continuous maps of the space $X$ into the space $Y$, we say that $f$ is \textbf{homotopic} to $f^{\prime}$
if there is a continuous map $F\colon X \times I \rightarrow Y$ such that
\[
    F(x, 0) = f(x) \text{ and } F(x, 1) = f^{\prime}(x)
\]
for each $x$. (Here $I = [0, 1]$.) The map $F$ is called a \textbf{homotopy} between $f$ and $f^{\prime}$. \\

If $f$ is homotopic to $f^{\prime}$, we write $f \simeq f^{\prime}$. If $f \simeq f^{\prime}$ and $f^{\prime}$ is a constant map, we say that
$f$ is \textbf{nulhomotopic}.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Think of a homotopy as a continuous one-parameter family of maps from $X$ to $Y$; the homotopy $F$ represents a continuous ``deforming'' of the map $f$ to $f^{\prime}$, 
as $t$ goes from $0$ to $1$.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Path Homotopy]
Two paths $f$ and $f^{\prime}$, mapping the interval $I = [0, 1]$ into $X$, are said to be \textbf{path homotopic} if they have the same initial point
$x_0$ and the same final point $x_1$, and if there is a continuous map $F\colon I \times I \rightarrow X$ such that
\begin{align*}
    F(s, 0) = f(s) &\text{ and } F(s, 1) = f^{\prime}(s), \\
    F(0, t) = x_0 &\text{ and } F(1, t) = x_1,
\end{align*}
for each $s \in I$ and each $t \in I$. We call $F$ a \textbf{path homotopy} between $f$ and $f^{\prime}$. If $f$ is path homotopic to $f^{\prime}$, we write $f \simeq_p f^{\prime}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The first condition says that $F$ is a homotopy between $f$ and $f^{\prime}$, or equivalently, that $F$ representsa continuous way of deforming the path $f$ to the path $f^{\prime}$. \\

The second condition says that for each $t$, the path $f_t$ definde by $f_t(s) = F(s, t)$ is a path from $x_0$ to $x_1$, or equivalently, the endpoints of path remain fixed during the deformation.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
The relations $\simeq$ and $\simeq_p$ are equivalence relations.
\end{lemma}

\begin{eg}
Let $f$ and $g$ be any two maps of a space $X$ into $\R^2$. The map 
\[
    F(x, t) = (1-t) f(x) + tg(x)
\]
is known as the \textbf{straight-line homotopy} between them.
\end{eg}

\begin{remark}
If $f$ and $g$ are paths from $x_0$ to $x_1$, then $F$ is a path homotopy. \\

More generally, let $A$ be a convex subspace of $\R^n$. Then any two paths $f, g$ in $A$ from $x_0$ to $x_1$ are path homotopic in $A$, as
the straight-line homotopy $F$ between them has image set in $A$.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Product]
If $f$ is a path in $X$ from $x_0$ to $x_1$, and if $g$ is a path in $X$ from $x_1$ to $x_2$, the \textbf{product} $f * g$ of $f$ and $g$ is the path $h$ given by
\[
    h(s) = \begin{cases}
        f(2s) &\text{ for } s \in \left[ 0, \frac{1}{2} \right] \\
        g(2s - 1) &\text{ for } s \in \left[ \frac{1}{2}, 1 \right]
    \end{cases}
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The function $h$ is well-defined and continuous, by the pasting lemma. It is a path in $X$ from $x_0$ to $x_2$. \\

The product operation on paths induce a well-defined operation on path-homotopy classes: $[f] * [g] = [f*g]$.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
The operation $*$ has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item (Associativity) If $[f] * ([g] * [h])$ is defined, so is $([f] * [g]) * [h]$, and they are equal.
    \item (Right and left identities) Given $x \in X$, let $e_x$ denote the constant path $e_x\colon I \rightarrow X$ carrying all of $I$ to the point $x$.
    If $f$ is a path from $x_0$ to $x_1$, then 
    \[
        [f] * [e_{x_1}] = [f] \text{ and } [e_{x_0}] * [f] = [f].
    \]
    \item (Inverse) Given the path $f$ in $X$ from $x_0$ to $x_1$, let $\overline{f}$ be the path defined by $\overline{f}(s) = f(1-s)$. It is the \textbf{reverse} of $f$. Then
    \[
        [f] * [\overline{f}] = [e_{x_0}] \text{ and } [\overline{f}] * [f] = [e_{x_1}].
    \]
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
Let $f$ be a path in $X$ and let $a_0, \dots, a_n$ be numbers such that $0 = a_0 < a_1 < \dots < a_n = 1$. Let $f_i\colon I \rightarrow X$ be the path that equals the positive linear map of $I$ onto $[a_{i-1}, a_i]$ followed by $f$. Then
\[
    [f] = [f_1] * \dots * [f_n].
\]
\end{theorem}


\subsection{The Fundamental Group}

\begin{definition}[Algebra Review]
A \textbf{homomorphism} $f\colon G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ is a map such that $f(x \cdot y) = f(x) \cdot f(y)$. (It follows that $f(e) = e^{\prime}$ and $f(x^{-1}) = f(x)^{-1}$.) \\

The \textbf{kernel} of $f$ is the set $f^{-1}(e^{\prime})$ and is a subgroup of $G$. The image is also a subgroup of $G$. \\

The homomorphism $f$ is called a \textbf{monomorphism} if it is injective (or equivalently, the kernel consists of $e$ alone), an \textbf{epimorphism} if it is surjective,
and an \textbf{isomorphism} if it is bijective.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Quotient Group]
If $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, the operation $(xH) \cdot (yH) = (x \cdot y)H$ is a well-defined operation on $G/H$ that makes it a group.
This is known as the \textbf{quotient} of $G$ by $H$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The map $f\colon G \rightarrow G/H$ mapping $x$ to $xH$ is an epimorphism with kernel $H$. \\

Conversely, if $f\colon G \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ is an epimorphism, then its kernel $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ and $f$ induces an isomorphism
$G/N \rightarrow G^{\prime}$ that carries $xN$ to $f(x)$ for each $x \in G$.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[The Fundamental Group]
Let $X$ be a space; let $x_0$ be a point of $X$. A path in $X$ that begins and ends at $x_0$ is called a \textbf{loop} based at $x_0$. \\

The set of path homotopy classes of loops based at $x_0$, with the operation $*$, is the \textbf{fundamental group} of $X$ relative to the \textbf{base point} $x_0$,
and is denoted by $\pi_1(X, x_0)$. This group is also sometimes called the \textbf{first homotopy group} of $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{eg}
$\pi_1(\R^n, x_0)$ is the trivial group -- if $f$ is a loop in $\R^n$ based at $x_0$, the straight-line homotopy is a path homotopy between $f$
and the constant path at $x_0$. \\

If $X$ is any convex subset of $\R^n$, then $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is the trivial group.
\end{eg}

\begin{definition}
Let $\alpha$ be a path in $X$ from $x_0$ to $x_1$. Define the map
\[
    \hat{\alpha} \colon \pi_1(X, x_0) \rightarrow \pi_1(X, x_1)
\]
by the equation
\[
    \hat{\alpha}([f]) = [\overline{\alpha}] * [f] * [\alpha].
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
$\hat{\alpha}$ is a group isomorphism.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
If $X$ is path connected and $x_0$ and $x_1$ are two points of $X$, then $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is isomorphic to $\pi_1(X, x_1)$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{definition}[Simply Connected]
A space $X$ is said to be \textbf{simply connected} if it is a path-connected space and if $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is the trivial one-element group
for some $x_0 \in X$, and hence for every $x_0 \in X$. (The trivial fundamental group is often expressed as $\pi_1(X, x_0) = 0$.)
\end{definition}


\begin{lemma}
In a simply connected space $X$, any two paths having the same initial and final points are path homotopic.
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}
Let $h\colon (X, x_0) \rightarrow (Y, y_0)$ be a continuous map. Define 
\[
    h_{\ast} \colon \pi_1(X, x_0) \rightarrow \pi _1(Y, y_0)
\]
by the equation $h_{\ast}([f]) = [h \circ f]$. The map $h_{\ast} $ is called the \textbf{homomorphism induced by $h$}, relative to the base point $x_0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
If $h\colon (X, x_0) \rightarrow (Y, y_0)$ and $k\colon (Y, y_0) \rightarrow (Z, z_0)$ is continuous, then $(k \circ h)_{\ast} = k_{\ast} \circ h_{\ast}$. If $i\colon (X, x_0) \rightarrow (X, x_0)$ is the identity map,
then $i_{\ast}$ is the identity homomorphism.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
If $h\colon (X, x_0) \rightarrow (Y, y_0)$ is a homeomorphism of $X$ with $Y$, then $h_{\ast} $ is an isomorphism of $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ with $\pi_1(Y, y_0)$.
\end{corollary}


\subsection{Covering Spaces}

\begin{definition}
Let $p\colon E \rightarrow B$ be a continuous surjective map. The open set $U$ of $B$ is said to be \textbf{evenly covered} by $p$ if the inverse image $p^{-1}(U)$ can be written as the
union of disjoint open sets $V_\alpha$ in $E$ such that for each $\alpha$, the restriction of $p$ to $V_\alpha$ is a homeomorphism of $V_\alpha$ onto $U$. \\

The collection $\{ V_\alpha \}$ is a partition of $p^{-1}(U)$ into \textbf{slices}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Covering Spaces]
Let $p\colon E \rightarrow B$ be a continuous surjective map. If every point $b$ of $B$ has a neighborhood $U$ that is evenly covered by $p$, then $p$ is a \textbf{covering map},
and $E$ is said to be a \textbf{covering space} of $B$.
\end{definition}

\begin{eg}
Let $X$ be any space; let $i\colon X \rightarrow X$ be the identity map. Then $i$ is a covering map. \\

More generally, let $E$ be the space $X \times \{ 1, 2, \dots, n \}$ consisting of $n$ disjoint copies of $X$. The map $p\colon E \rightarrow X$ given by $p(x, i) = x$ 
for all $i$ is a covering map.
\end{eg}

\begin{theorem}
The map $p\colon \R \rightarrow S^1$ given by 
\[
    p(x) = (\cos 2\pi x, \sin 2\pi x)
\]
is a covering map.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Local homeomorphism]
If $p\colon E \rightarrow B$ is a covering map, then $p$ is a \textbf{local homeomorphism} of $E$ with $B$. \\

That is, each point $e$ of $E$ has a neighborhood that is mapped homeomorphically by $p$ onto an open subset of $B$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
Let $p\colon E \rightarrow B$ be a covering map. If $B_0$ is a subspace of $B$, and if $E_0 = p^{-1}(B_0)$, then the map $p_0\colon E_0 \rightarrow B_0$ obtained by
restricting $p$ is a coveirng map.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
If $p\colon E \rightarrow B$ and $p^{\prime}\colon E^{\prime} \rightarrow B^{\prime}$ are covering maps, then
\[
    p \times p^{\prime} \colon E \times E^{\prime} \rightarrow B \times B^{\prime}
\]
is a covering map.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{The Fundamental Group of the Circle}

\begin{definition}[Lifting]
Let $p\colon E \rightarrow B$ be a map. If $f$ is a continuous mapping of some space $X$ into $B$, a \textbf{lifting} of $f$ is a map $\tilde{f}\colon X \rightarrow E$ such that $p \circ \tilde{f} = f$. 
\end{definition}


\begin{eg}
Consider the covering $p\colon \R \rightarrow S^1$ given by $p(x) = (\cos (2\pi x), \sin (2\pi x))$. \\

The path $f\colon [0, 1] \rightarrow S^1$ beginning at $b_0 = (1, 0)$ given by $f(s) = (\cos (\pi s), \sin (\pi s))$ lifts to the path $\tilde{f}(s) = \frac{s}{2}$ beginning at $0$ and ending at $\frac{1}{2}$.
\end{eg}

\begin{lemma}
Let $p\colon E \rightarrow B$ be a covering map, let $p(e_0) = b_0$. Any path $f\colon [0, 1] \rightarrow B$ beginning at $b_0$ has a unique lifting to a path $\tilde{f}$ in $E$ beginning at $e_0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
Let $p\colon E \rightarrow B$ be a covering map, let $p(e_0) = b_0$. Let the map $F\colon I \times I \rightarrow B$ be continuous, with $F(0, 0) = b_0$. There is a unique lifting of $F$ to a continuous map
\[
    \tilde{F}\colon I \times I \rightarrow E
\]
such that $\tilde{F}(0, 0) = e_0$. If $F$ is a path homotopy, then $\tilde{F}$ is a path homotopy.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}
Let $p\colon E \rightarrow B$ be a covering map, let $p(e_0) = b_0$. Let $f$ and $g$ be two paths in $B$ from $b_0$ to $b_1$ and let $\tilde{f}$ and $\tilde{g}$ be their respective liftings to paths in $E$ beginning at $e_0$.
If $f$ and $g$ are path homotopic, then $\tilde{f}$ and $\tilde{g}$ end at the same point of $E$ and are path homotopic.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Lifting Correspondence]
Let $p\colon E \rightarrow B$ be a covering map and let $b_0 \in B$. Choose $e_0$ so that $p(e_0) = b_0$. Given an element $[f] \in \pi _1(X, x_0)$, let $\tilde{f}$ be the lifting of $f$ to a path in $E$ that begins at $e_0$. 
Let $\phi([f])$ denote the endpoint of $\tilde{f}(1)$ of $\tilde{f}$. Then $\phi$ is a well-defined set map
\[
    \phi\colon \pi _1(B, b_0) \rightarrow p^{-1}(b_0).
\]
$\phi$ is the \textbf{lifting correspondence} derived from the covering map $p$, and depends on the choice of $e_0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
Let $p\colon E \rightarrow B$ be a covering map, let $p(e_0) = b_0$. If $E$ is path connected then the lifting correspondence 
\[
    \phi\colon \pi _1(B, b_0) \rightarrow p^{-1}(b_0)
\]
is surjective. If $E$ is simply connected, it is bijective.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
The fundamental group of $S^1$ is isomorphic to the additive group of integers.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
Let $p\colon E \rightarrow B$ be a covering map, let $p(e_0) = b_0$.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item The homomorphism $p_{\ast} \colon \pi _1(E, e_0) \rightarrow \pi _1(B, b_0)$ is a monomorphism.
    \item Let $H = p_{\ast} (\pi _1(E, e_0))$. The lifting correspondence $\phi$ induces an injective map
    \[
        \Phi\colon \pi _1(B, b_0) / H \rightarrow p^{-1}(b_0)
    \]
    of the collection of right cosets of $H$ into $p^{-1}(b_0)$, which is bijective if $E$ is path connected.
    \item If $f$ is a loop in $B$ based at $b_0$, then $[f] \in H$ if and only if $f$ lifts to a loop in $E$ based at $e_0$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}


\subsection{Retractions and Fixed Points}

\begin{definition}
If $A \subset X$, a \textbf{retraction} of $X$ onto $A$ is a continuous map $r\colon X \rightarrow  A$ such that $r \mid A$ is the identity map of $A$. \\

If such a map exists, then $A$ is known as a \textbf{retract} of $X$.
\end{definition}
