\subsection{Direct Sums of Abelian Groups}

\begin{definition}
Suppose $G$ is an abelian group, and $\{ G_\alpha \}_{\alpha \in J}$ is an indexed family of subgroups of $G$. \\

The groups $G_\alpha$ \textbf{generate} $G$ if every element $x$ of $G$ can be written as a finite sum of elements of the groups $G_\alpha$. \\

$G$ is a \textbf{direct sum} of the groups $G_\alpha$ if for each $x \in G$, there is only one $J$-tuple $(x_\alpha)_{\alpha \in J}$ with $x_\alpha = 0$ for all 
but finitely many $\alpha$ such that $x = \sum x_\alpha$. $G$ is written as
\[
    G = \bigoplus_{\alpha \in J} G_\alpha.
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{eg}
The cartesian product $\R^\omega$ is an abelian group under the operation of coordinate-wise addition. The set $G_n$ consisting 
of those tuples $(x_i)$ such that $x_i = 0$ for $i \neq n$ is a subgroup isomorphic to $\R$.
\end{eg}

The following lemma characterize the extension condition for direct sums:
\begin{lemma}
Let $G$ be an abelian group; let $\{ G_\alpha \}$ be a family of subgroups of $G$. If $G$ is the direct sum of the groups $G_\alpha$, then
$G$ satisfies the following condition: \\

\textit{Given any abelian group $H$ and any family of homomorphisms $h_\alpha \colon G_\alpha \rightarrow H$, there exists a homomorphism $h\colon G \rightarrow H$ whose restriction
to $G_\alpha$ equals $h_\alpha$, for each $\alpha$.}
\end{lemma}
