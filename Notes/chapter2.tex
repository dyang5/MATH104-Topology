\subsection{Topological Spaces}
\begin{definition}[Topology]
A \textbf{topology} on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathscr{T}$ of subsets of $X$ having the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\varnothing$ and $X$ are in $\mathscr{T}$.
    \item The union of the elements of any subcollection of $\mathscr{T}$ is in $\mathscr{T}$.
    \item The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of $\mathscr{T}$ is in $\mathscr{T}$.
\end{enumerate}
A set $X$ for which a topology $\mathscr{T}$ has been specified is a \textbf{topological space}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Open Set]
If $X$ is a topological space with topology $\mathscr{T}$, a subset $U$ of $X$ is an \textbf{open set} of $X$
if $U$ belongs to the collection $\mathscr{T}$.  
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Using the open set terminology, a topological space can be thought of as a set $X$ together with a collection
of subsets of $X$, called \textit{open sets}, such that $\varnothing$ and $X$ are both open, and such that arbitrary unions
and finite intersections of open sets are open.
\end{remark}

\begin{eg}
The topologies on $X = \{ a, b, c \}$ can be specified by permuting $a$, $b$, and $c$ and specifying the open sets defined by subsets of $X$. \\

However, note that not every collection of subsets of $X$ is a topology on $X$: consider 
\[
    \{\{ a, b \}, \{ b, c \}, \{  a, b, c \}\}.
\]
This is not closed under intersection.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}
Let $X$ be any set. The collection of all subsets of $X$ is a topology on $X$ known as the \textbf{discrete topology}. \\

The collection consisting of only $\varnothing$ and $X$ is also a topology on $X$ known as the \textbf{indiscrete topology} (or \textbf{trivial topology}).
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}
Let $X$ be a set and let $\mathscr{T}_f$ be the collection of all subsets $U$ of $X$ such that $X--U$ either is finite or all of $X$. Then $\mathscr{T}_f$ is a topology on $X$
known as the \textbf{finite complement topology}. \\

Similarly, let $X$ be a set and let $\mathscr{T}_c$ be the collection of all subsets $U$ of $X$ such that $X--U$ either is countable or is all of $X$. 
Then $\mathscr{T}_c$ is a topology on $X$.
\end{eg}

\begin{definition}[Finer and Coarser Topologies]
Suppose $\mathscr{T}$ and $\mathscr{T}^{\prime}$ are two topologies on a given set $X$. If $\mathscr{T}^{\prime} \subset \mathscr{T}$, $\mathscr{T}^{\prime}$ is \textbf{finer} than $\mathscr{T}$;
if $\mathscr{T}^{\prime}$ properly contains $\mathscr{T}$, then $\mathscr{T}^{\prime}$ is \textbf{strictly finer} than $\mathscr{T}$. \\

In the resepctive situations, we say that $\mathscr{T}$ is \textbf{coarser} than $\mathscr{T^{\prime}}$;
and $\mathscr{T}$ is \textbf{strictly coarser} than $\mathscr{T}^{\prime}$. \\

$\mathscr{T}$ is \textbf{comparable} with $\mathscr{T}^{\prime}$ if either $\mathscr{T}^{\prime} \subset \mathscr{T}$ or $\mathscr{T} \subset \mathscr{T}^{\prime}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{intuition}
Think of a topological space as something like a truckload full of gravel. Then the pebbles and all unions of collections of pebbles are the open sets.\\

Furthermore, if the pebbles are smashed into smaller pieces, the collection of open sets has been enlarged, adn the topology, like the gravel, is made finer by the operation.
\end{intuition}

\begin{remark}
The finer and coaser terminology can also be replaced by \textbf{larger} and \textbf{smaller} as well as \textbf{stronger} and \textbf{weaker}, respectively.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Basis for a Topology}

Instead of specifying a topology by describing the entire collection $\mathscr{T}$ of open sets, it is often easier to specify a smaller collection of subsets of $X$ and 
to define the topology from that collection.
\begin{definition}[Basis for Topology]
If $X$ is a set, a \textbf{basis} for a topology on $X$ is a collection $\mathscr{B}$ of subsets of $X$ (\textbf{basis elements}) such that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For each $x \in X$, there is at least one basis element $B$ containing $x$.
    \item If $x$ belongs to the intersection of two basis elements $B_1$ and $B_2$, then there is a basis element $B_3$ containing $x$ such that $B_3 = B_1 \cap B_2$.
\end{enumerate}

If $\mathscr{B}$ satisfies these conditions, then the \textbf{topology $\mathscr{T}$ generated by $\mathscr{B}$} is defined as follows:
a subset $U$ of $X$ is said to be open in $X$ (or an element of $\mathscr{T}$) if for each $x \in U$, there is a basis element $B \in \mathscr{B}$ such that $x \in B$ and $B \subset U$
(each basis element is itself an element of $\mathscr{T}$).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The collection $\mathscr{T}$ generated by the basis $\mathscr{B}$ satisfies the requirements for a topology on $X$: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The empty set and $X$ are both in $\mathscr{T}$
    \item $U = \bigcup_{\alpha \in J} U_\alpha$ for an indexed family $\{ U_\alpha \}_{\alpha \in J}$ of elements of $\mathscr{T}$ belongs to $\mathscr{T}$
    \item The intersection of two elements $U_1$ and $U_2$ in $\mathscr{T}$ is also in $\mathscr{T}$; the finite intersection case follows from induction.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{eg}
Let $\mathscr{B}$ be the collection of all circular regions (interiors of circles) in the plane; $\mathscr{B}$ is a basis.
In the topology generated by $\mathscr{B}$, a subset $U$ of the plane is open if every $x \in U$ lies in some circular region contained in $U$.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}
If $X$ is any set, the collection of all one-point subsets in $X$ is a basis for the discrete topology on $X$.
\end{eg}

\begin{lemma}
Let $X$ be a set; let $\mathscr{B}$ be a basis for a topology $\mathscr{T}$ on $X$. Then $\mathscr{T}$ equals the collection of
all unions of elements of $\mathscr{B}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}
The above lemma tells us that every open set $U$ in $X$ can be expressed as a union of basis elements. However, unlike the notion of a basis
in linear algebra, this expression may not be unique.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}[Obtaining a Basis from a Topology]
Let $X$ be a topological space. Suppose that $\mathscr{C}$ is a collection of open sets of $X$ such that for each open set $U$ of $X$ and each $x$ in $U$,
there is an element $C$ of $\mathscr{C}$ such that $x \in C \subset U$. Then $\mathscr{C}$ is a basis for the topology of $X$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Comparing Fineness of Topologies]
Let $\mathscr{B}$ and $\mathscr{B}^{\prime}$ be bases for the topologies $\mathscr{T}$ and $\mathscr{T}^{\prime}$, respectively, on $X$. Then the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\mathscr{T}^{\prime}$ is finer than $\mathscr{T}$.
    \item For each $x \in X$ and each basis element $B \in \mathscr{B}$ containing $x$, there is a basis element $B^{\prime} \in \mathscr{B}^{\prime}$ such that $x \in B^{\prime} \subset B$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}


\begin{intuition}
Recall the analogy between a topological space and a truckload of gravel. Here, the pebbles are the basis elements of the topology; 
after the pebbles are smashed into dust, the dust particles are the basis elements for the new topology. 
The new topology is finer than the old one, and the dust particle was previously contained in a pebble.
\end{intuition}

\begin{remark}
The collection of all circular regions in the plane generates the same topology as the collection of all rectangular regions in the plane:
each rectangle in the rectangular basis has a circle enclosed in it, and each circle in the circular basis has a rectangle enclosed in it. 
This tells us that each topology is finer than the other, and so they generate the same topology.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Topologies on $\R$]
Let $\mathscr{B}$ be the collection of open intervals on the real line; the \textbf{standard topology} on the real line is the topology generated by $\mathscr{B}$. \\

Let $\mathscr{B}^{\prime}$ be the collection of all half-open intervals $[a, b)$ on the real line; the \textbf{lower limit topology} on the real line 
is the topology generated by $\mathscr{B}^{\prime}$ and is denoted by $\R_\ell$. \\

Finally, let $K$ be the set of all numbers of the form $\frac{1}{n}$ for $n \in \Z_+$. Let $\mathscr{B}^{\prime\prime}$ be the collection
of all open intervals along with sets of the form $(a, b) -- K$. The topology generated by $\mathscr{B}^{\prime\prime}$ is the \textbf{K-topology} on $\R$, denoted by $\R_k$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Subbasis for a Topology]
A \textbf{subbasis} $\mathscr{S}$ for a topology on $X$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ whose union equals $X$. \\

The \textbf{topology generated by the subbasis $\mathscr{S}$} is the collection $\mathscr{T}$ of all unions of finite intersections of elements of $\mathscr{S}$.
\end{definition}
