\subsection{Topological Spaces}
\begin{definition}[Topology]
A \textbf{topology} on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathscr{T}$ of subsets of $X$ having the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\varnothing$ and $X$ are in $\mathscr{T}$.
    \item The union of the elements of any subcollection of $\mathscr{T}$ is in $\mathscr{T}$.
    \item The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of $\mathscr{T}$ is in $\mathscr{T}$.
\end{enumerate}
A set $X$ for which a topology $\mathscr{T}$ has been specified is a \textbf{topological space}.
\end{definition}
