\textit{Assorted Topological Groups Problems.} \\

\underline{Section 26 (Compact Spaces), 26.13(a)(b)} \\

\textbf{Let $G$ be a topological group.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Let $A$ and $B$ be subspaces of $G$. If $A$ is closed and $B$ is compact, show $A \cdot B$ is closed. [\textit{Hint:} If $c$ is not in $A \cdot B$, find a neighborhood $W$ of $c$ such that
    $W \cdot B^{-1}$ is disjoint from $A$.]}

    \begin{solution}
    To show that $A \cdot B$ is closed, we will show that $(A \cdot B)^C$ is open. Let $c \in (A \cdot B)^C$. As the hint says, we will show that there is a neighborhood $W$ of $c$ such that
    $W \cdot B^{-1}$ is disjoint from $A$. \\
    
    Since $G$ is a topological group, it follows from Exercise 145.1 that the map $f \colon G \times G \rightarrow G$ sending $(x, y)$ to $xy^{-1}$ is continuous. $A$ is closed, so $A^C$ is open. Since $f$ is continuous, the preimage of an open set is open, and so $f^{-1}(A^C)$ is open. The one-point set $\{ c \}$ and $B$ are each compact. We claim that $\{c\} \times B \subseteq f^{-1}(A^C)$. 
    Equivalently, we will show that $f(\{ c \} \times B) \subseteq A^C$. Since $c \in (A \cdot B)^C$, or equivalently, $c \notin A \cdot B$, it follows that $c \neq ab$ for any $a \in A$, $b \in B$. Equivalently, $c b^{-1} \neq a$ for any $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. Since $f(\{ c \} \times B)$ is defined as $\{cb^{-1} \mid b \in B\}$, 
    it follows that $f(\{c \} \times B)$ and $A$ are disjoint, or equivalently, $f(\{ c \} \times B) \subseteq A^C$. \\

    To summarize, we have that $f^{-1}(A^C)$ is an open set in $G \times G$, and $\{ c\}$ and $B$ are each compact in $G$, with $\{c \} \times B \subseteq f^{-1}(A^C)$. It follows by Exercise 26.9 that there exist open sets $W$ and $V$ in $G$ such that
    \[
        \{ c \} \times B \subseteq W \times V \subseteq f^{-1}(A^C).
    \]
    Note that $c \in W$ by construction, and $W \times B \subseteq W \times V$. Consequently, since $W \times B \subseteq W \times V \subseteq f^{-1}(A^C)$, it follows that $f(W \times B) \subseteq A^C$, or equivalently
    \[
        W \cdot B^{-1} \subseteq A^C.
    \]
    It follows that $(W \cdot B^{-1}) \cap A = \varnothing$. Consequently, $wb^{-1} \neq a$ for any $w \in W, a \in A$ and $b \in B$. Equivalently, $w \neq ab$, so $W \cap (A \cdot B) = \varnothing$. \\

    For any arbitrary $c \in (A \cdot B)^C$, we have found a neighborhood $W$ of $c$ such that $W \cap (A \cdot B) = \varnothing$, or equivalently, $W \subseteq (A \cdot B)^C$. It follows by definition that $(A \cdot B)^C$ is open in $G$,
    so $A \cdot B$ is closed, as desired.

\textbf{Let $G$ be a topological group with operation $\cdot$ and identity element $x_0$. Let $\Omega(G, x_0)$ denote the set of all loops in $G$ based at $x_0$. If $f, g \in \Omega(G, x_0)$, 
let us define a loop $f \otimes g$ by the rule}

    \item \textbf{Show that the two group operations $*$ and $\otimes$ on $\pi_1(G, x_0)$ are the same. [\textit{Hint:} Compute $(f * e_{x_0}) \otimes (e_{x_0} * g)$.]}
